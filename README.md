# Fraud-Detection
Online fraudulent transactions are a significant criminal violation. Every year, it costs people and financial institutions billions of dollars. It emphasizes the crucial importance of financial institutions in detecting and preventing fraudulent acts. Machine learning algorithms provide a proactive way mechanism to prevent online transaction frauds with high accuracy.Online transaction fraud is a simple and easy target. E-commerce and other online sites have increased the number of online payment methods, raising the danger of online fraud. With the rise in fraud rates, machine learning approaches can be used to identify and evaluate fraud in online transactions. The primary goal of this project is to implement supervised machine learning models for fraud detection, with the goal of analyzing prior transaction information.The goal is to predict whether a transaction is a legal transaction or a fraudulent transaction, this falls under the scope of a classification problem. We intend to deploy Supervised Machine Learning models in order to achieve the highest prediction accuracy.
